# Immigration App #

Amies is an Android application designed to help new immigrants integrate into Vancouver. Despite time constraints and a reduced team size, we focused on creating a comprehensive app using Figma and Android Studio. Although we couldn't complete all the coding, we delivered a compelling presentation and won the runner-up "People's Choice Award," with me receiving the "Get Stuff Done" award.

### Investigation ##

Using skills that we have learned over the course of the Game of Apps Program, we planned to create an app that fits the theme of equity. Since we all have relations to immigrations and experience in relation to immigration, we decided to create an immigration app to help facilitate the process of getting used to the culture and society. Sonja and Lecia had previously learned some coding in Java and xml. Zayn was very proficient in Java and coding in general. Yunso and Lina learned about design, although Sonja also had interest and partook in designing processes. Ryan had some previous coding experiences. We had two groups, Designers and Developers to design and develop the app, which later became “AMIES”.

### Preperation ###
We had to first plan what app we were going to make. We looked into equity in the aspects of finance, social and education. At first we decided to choose education, since as high school students, it's what we relate to the most; however, it is difficult to claim if there is a lack of equity already and we do not have anyone, who we can easily access, who need this equity. 

Then we looked into finance, but we aren’t proficient enough to know much; therefore, we turned to social equity. Immigration happened to be something all of us could relate to and found impacted many people so we chose to work on this as a problem space. In preparation, we continued our brainstorm on the “Team Brainstorm” google doc and on the figma files to see what problems we want to solve with our app. Then, we looked into what functions we could input into our app to solve or help with those problems. 

### Action ###
The progression of creating this app from planning to its final product took three months to complete. During this time of action when creating our app we met with our mentors every week on Tuesday for around one hour to discuss our progress with creating this app. On top of that around 2 months before our project was due, we began meeting our mentors around 3 times a week, on Tuesday afternoon and during the weekends for 3 hours at a time. 

After brainstorming some ideas that we thought would work, we began designing the app to fit our idea of what would be a solution to the problem of inequity, which was an immigration app. We began with seeing what parts of app were required to make our app work. We created some potential panels and designs. We wanted our app to be a place where immigrants could learn English, learn the cultural background, history of Canada, and their community. Our app was centered around greater Vancouver. 

One of the major discussions for designing this app was the navigation bar. Our group wanted the app to have navigation buttons on the bottom of the phone, thus the user could find everything they wanted in the limited space of the phone. Therefore we ended up splitting our app into 4 sections on the navigation bar which were the home page, language, location, and profile. The home bar was based off what the user chose according to their needs and their purpose of using the app. We took inspiration from the Tiktok introduction menu page when first logging into an account for this aspect. Thus, we followed a similar design where we listed many bubbles for them to choose from and based off their choices, the home page would display their choices. For instance, if the user was interested in learning about Canadian history, we would list posts about Canadian history on their home page. 

We first drafted a potential design for every single navigation button’s page. It was extremely simple and more of an idea of what we wanted them to look like. As can be seen by our final product, this ended up looking much more different. Despite this initial design, our mentors did not seem to like the design, as we were unable to back up our claims as to how these features we had created could solve the problem of inequity. So, we went back to our problem statement that we had created during the brainstorming phase to get a better understanding what we wanted to target when creating our features. As a result we were able to create a much more detailed user flow that could help to solve our problem statement. 

After our user flow we were able to redo our layouts and complete the onboarding stage. This time when we created our layouts they were much more minimalistic not based off of what our actual app was going to be. It was just the bare bones. This image was of the introduction of the app, which is what a user would see when opening the app for the first time. Thus, they would go through a series of questions in order to modify the app to suit their desires.

After creating this, we created the inner layout of our app, not just the introductory panels. It was similar to what we had before. However, this time with the mentors’ help we made the panel’s design and purpose more meaningful and helpful towards the user. For instance, the location navigation button would be able to find the local community centers that offered English lessons for the user if they were wanting to learn English. 

After all this planning with the layouts we were able to add some embellishments to the design, such as color, fonts, etc. We ended up choosing a color scheme that we thought would work across the app. The colours of a neapolitan ice cream is what we ended up landing on because of its nice soothing tones. They were very pastel and cute.  

We did not change much of the design of our app other than just adding embellishments such as the various colour palettes. 

### Designing Logo ###


We also spent some time designing our potential logo. We decided to use circles because we wanted it to symbolize a globe which was because immigrants came from all over the globe. The logo used the same colour scheme as our app. However we used deeper tones of the pink and green to make the logo stand out when displayed in the app. We ended up using the logo that can be seen on the bottom left. 


### Coding ###

After creating all these design panels, we began coding. We coded the design in the platform Android Studio with the language Java and xml for the layouts. We were able to code together through the use of Sourcetree, it was like a google drive where we were all able to share the files and see each other, to make sure we were not overlapping each other’s progress. We were only able to begin coding around 2 weeks before the app was supposed to be due as we spent the majority of our time brainstorming and designing the app. An example of our code and page that it was able to layout can be seen below.

Due to our time crunch of only 2 weeks, we were unable to complete the code for all our apps. However, we still had to showcase what we had done for the competition. Therefore we began designing the videos for the presentation. 

We made the video for the presentation which can be seen on youtube, in one of the links in the Demonstration CAS stage. It was presented during the showcase and we answered the questions from various guests about our app. It ended up being quite an amazing experience despite being extremely stressful at times. 

### Reflection ###

Considering how this year went with the constant all-nighters…this experience taught us the great importance of time management skills, which is the only reason why we even consider doing the program again next year. Our practice this year has allowed us to be more productive and balance our schedules better.

We learned a lot of coding through the lessons and hands-on experience with building apps while also making many new friends! There are times and moments while being in this program where we felt low and tired due to all the stress there is with both school and the large time commitment of creating these projects. However, knowing that we were not alone because together with the team members, we were in the same boat was definitely quite reassuring. We really enjoyed the memories of chatting with these friends from midnight to dawn. Although we were working together on these apps, we also talked about other topics outside of school, allowing us to grow closer.

Although we were in the developer stream, we spent a large majority of my time also helping out with the designers when coming up with a design for the app. We never expected ourselves to enjoy the design aspect so much. It is a great balance to development which is more applications based; converting the designs to actual functions. Designing is more creative. We were able to bring what we had envisioned for an app to life. This knowledge we gained has leaked into our personal life when using different applications. Oftentimes, unconsciously, I find myself analyzing popular applications either commenting or criticizing the design and how it could be better or more consistent.
