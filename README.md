## 🧐 Investigation

Using skills that we have learned over the course of the Game of Apps Program, we planned to create an app that fits the theme of **equity**. Since we all have relations to immigration and experience in relation to immigration, we decided to create an immigration app to help facilitate the process of getting used to the culture and society. 

Sonja and Lecia had previously learned some coding in **Java** and **XML**. Zayn was very proficient in **Java** and coding in general. Yunso and Lina learned about design, although Sonja also had interest and partook in the designing processes. Ryan had some previous coding experiences. We had two groups: Designers and Developers to design and develop the app, which later became **AMIES**. 🌎

## 📝 Preparation

We first brainstormed what app we would make. Initially, we explored equity in the aspects of finance, social, and education. At first, we decided to focus on **education**, but it was difficult to claim if there was a lack of equity in this area. We also explored **finance**, but we weren’t proficient enough to proceed, so we pivoted to **social equity**.

Immigration, a topic all of us could relate to, was a clear choice. We began planning and brainstorming in our **Team Brainstorm** Google doc and **Figma** files to solve the problems we identified. 

## 🚀 Action

The progression of creating this app from planning to its final product took **three months**. During this time, we met with our mentors weekly on Tuesdays for around **one hour** to discuss our progress. Two months before the deadline, we began meeting with mentors up to **three times a week** to make significant strides.

Our design process focused on creating an app that was user-friendly and addressed the problem of inequity. We aimed to offer a platform where immigrants could learn **English**, explore **Canadian history**, and understand **local culture**. 🌍📚

### Major Design Discussion
A key challenge in the design was the **navigation bar**. We wanted the app to have a bottom navigation bar with **four sections**:
- Home
- Language
- Location
- Profile

The **Home** page would dynamically adjust to the user's preferences and needs, displaying content such as Canadian history or local community events. We also aimed for the design to be minimalist and user-centered. 🖥️✨

## 🖌️ Designing Logo

We also spent time designing our app's logo, which symbolizes a **globe** to represent the diverse backgrounds of immigrants. The logo used a color scheme similar to our app, inspired by soothing pastel shades. 🌐🎨

## 💻 Coding

After finalizing the designs, we began coding in **Android Studio** using **Java** and **XML** for layouts. We used **SourceTree** to collaborate and avoid overlapping work. However, due to time constraints, we were only able to begin coding **two weeks before the project deadline**. 

While we couldn’t complete the entire code, we still created a **compelling presentation** to showcase our progress. 🎥📱

## 🌟 Reflection

This experience taught us the importance of **time management** and the balance between **design** and **development**. We enjoyed the process of **collaborating** and creating an app from scratch, even if it was challenging at times. The project not only enhanced our technical skills but also our creativity and teamwork.

Though we were in the developer stream, we spent a significant amount of time assisting with the **design process**. It was surprising how much we enjoyed designing, which was a great balance to the technical aspect of app development. 💡

This knowledge has carried over into our personal lives as we now find ourselves analyzing app designs more critically and thinking about how designs could be improved. 💬
